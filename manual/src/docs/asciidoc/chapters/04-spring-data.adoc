= Spring Data

The Spring Data module contains stub implementation of the Spring Data repository interfaces, which can be used to replace actual database access in tests.

For instance, if we want to create a test for a service, which injects a CrudRepository, we can simply use a CrudRepositoryStub instead of a real repository.


== Create the Stub

Let's assume we have a service `TestService`, which injects a Spring Data `CrudRepository` named `TestCrudRepository`:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::../../../test/java/org/stubit/springdata/SpringDataDocTest.java[tag=service, indent=0]
----

We want to test this service without accessing the database and without specifying its internal behaviour (via a Mock).

`TestCrudRepository` is a typical Spring Data repository interface with only one additional method `findByName`:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::../../../test/java/org/stubit/springdata/SpringDataDocTest.java[tag=repository, indent=0]
----

In oder to create a stub, we need to implement this interface.
By extending from the link:{javadoc-url}/spring-data/org/stubit/springdata/CrudRepositoryStub.html[`CrudRepositoryStub`], this only requires to implement the `findByName` method:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::../../../test/java/org/stubit/springdata/SpringDataDocTest.java[tag=implement, indent=0]
----


== Use the Stub

In a test we can now use the `TestCrudRepositoryStub` instead of the real repository:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::../../../test/java/org/stubit/springdata/SpringDataDocTest.java[tag=create, indent=0]
include::../../../test/java/org/stubit/springdata/SpringDataDocTest.java[tag=inject, indent=0]
----

Now we can prepare our test scenario by simply adding entities to the stub.
Either one-by-one:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::../../../test/java/org/stubit/springdata/SpringDataDocTest.java[tag=fillSingle, indent=0]
----

Or multiple at once:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::../../../test/java/org/stubit/springdata/SpringDataDocTest.java[tag=fillMultiple, indent=0]
----

It is quite handy, that the save methods of a `CrudRepository` return the saved entity, so we can easily add the entity to the stub and use the returned entity in our test.


== Verify the Stub

After the test, we can verify the stub by checking the entities in the stub:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::../../../test/java/org/stubit/springdata/SpringDataDocTest.java[tag=verify, indent=0]
----


== Reusing a Stub

Note that a link:{javadoc-url}/spring-data/org/stubit/springdata/CrudRepositoryStub.html[`CrudRepositoryStub`] is basically a glorified `HashMap`, so we can simply create a new instance for every test.

However, that might require to recreate the service as well.
So, if we want to reuse the stub, we can simply use the `deleteAll` method to clear the stub:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::../../../test/java/org/stubit/springdata/SpringDataDocTest.java[tag=clear, indent=0]
----
